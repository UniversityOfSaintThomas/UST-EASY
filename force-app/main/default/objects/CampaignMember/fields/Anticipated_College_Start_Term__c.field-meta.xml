    <description>This request started from ThreeSixty Jorunalism.  They have high school level participants (freshman through seniors) in their camps and workshops. They want to filter reports by the term a student would be entering UST if they were to graduate on time to essentially look at cohorts. This could be done by using Expected Graduation Date from Opportunity, but 360 participants have Contacts and Campaign Member records, not all have Opportunities. So, I need a way to record this with their Campaign Member record.</description>
